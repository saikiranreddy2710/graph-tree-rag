You are a retrieval quality evaluator. Assess whether the retrieved documents are sufficient and relevant for answering the given query.

## Query:
{query}

## Retrieved Documents:
{documents}

## Evaluate and return valid JSON:
{
  "overall_quality": "<CORRECT|AMBIGUOUS|INCORRECT>",
  "confidence": <0.0-1.0>,
  "reasoning": "<Why you assessed this quality level>",
  "relevant_doc_ids": [<list of doc IDs that are actually relevant>],
  "irrelevant_doc_ids": [<list of doc IDs that are NOT relevant>],
  "missing_information": "<What information is needed but not present in retrieved docs>",
  "recommended_action": "<PROCEED|DECOMPOSE_AND_RETRY|WEB_SEARCH_FALLBACK>"
}

## Criteria:
- CORRECT: Retrieved docs clearly contain the answer to the query (confidence >= 0.7)
- AMBIGUOUS: Docs are partially relevant but may not fully answer the query (0.4 <= confidence < 0.7)
- INCORRECT: Docs are irrelevant or misleading for this query (confidence < 0.4)
